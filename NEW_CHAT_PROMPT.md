# üöÄ MCP macOS Companion - Continue Development (New Chat Prompt)

## üìç **CURRENT STATUS: Backend 100% Complete - Ready for SwiftUI Menu Bar App**

I'm continuing development of the MCP macOS Companion project. All backend services are now fully operational after fixing critical issues in the Workflow Orchestrator and Whisper Client.

## ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED WORKING SERVICES (6/6)**

All services are running and healthy on localhost:

- **Service Registry** (Port 8080) - Service discovery & health monitoring ‚úÖ
- **Memory Engine** (Port 8081) - Semantic search with sentence-transformers ‚úÖ  
- **Finder Actions** (Port 8082) - Smart file organization ‚úÖ
- **Screen Vision** (Port 8083) - Screen capture and OCR ‚úÖ
- **Workflow Orchestrator** (Port 8084) - Intelligence brain with workflows ‚úÖ **RECENTLY FIXED**
- **Whisper Client** (Port 8085) - Speech-to-text (Mock version) ‚úÖ **RECENTLY FIXED**

## üîß **WHAT WAS RECENTLY FIXED**

1. **Workflow Orchestrator** - Fixed IndentationError and malformed `_load_default_templates()` method
2. **Whisper Client** - Created working mock version to bypass PyAudio dependency issues
3. **Integration** - All services now communicate properly via service registry

## üíª **SYSTEM INFO**

- **Platform**: macOS 15, M1 iMac  
- **Project Path**: `/Users/mark/Desktop/MCP STUFF/mcp-macos-companion/`
- **Python**: Virtual environment with all dependencies installed
- **Status**: Backend infrastructure complete and tested

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT GOAL: SwiftUI Menu Bar App**

I need to create a native macOS menu bar application with these features:

### **Core Requirements**
1. **Menu Bar Icon** - Shows system status at a glance
2. **Service Status Monitor** - Live health checks of all 6 services
3. **Quick Actions** - One-click workflow triggers
4. **Preferences Panel** - Service configuration
5. **Workflow Management** - Create, edit, execute workflows
6. **Notifications** - System alerts for completions

### **Technical Approach**
- Swift + SwiftUI for native macOS experience
- HTTP API calls to backend services (ports 8080-8085)
- NSStatusItem for menu bar integration
- UserNotifications for system alerts
- Combine for reactive UI updates

## üîÑ **VERIFICATION COMMANDS**

To verify services are still running:

```bash
cd "/Users/mark/Desktop/MCP STUFF/mcp-macos-companion"
source venv/bin/activate

# Check all services
curl http://localhost:8080/health  # Service Registry
curl http://localhost:8081/health  # Memory Engine  
curl http://localhost:8082/health  # Finder Actions
curl http://localhost:8083/health  # Screen Vision
curl http://localhost:8084/health  # Workflow Orchestrator
curl http://localhost:8085/health  # Whisper Client Mock

# View registered services
curl http://localhost:8080/services

# Test workflow functionality  
curl http://localhost:8084/templates
```

## üìã **SPECIFIC NEXT ACTIONS**

1. **Create Xcode Project** - New macOS app with SwiftUI
2. **Design Menu Bar Interface** - Status icon and dropdown menu
3. **Implement Service Communication** - HTTP client for API calls
4. **Build Status Dashboard** - Real-time service health monitoring
5. **Add Quick Actions** - Workflow trigger buttons
6. **Create Preferences** - Settings panel for configuration

## üí° **CONTEXT FOR AI ASSISTANT**

I'm ready to move from backend development to frontend development. The MCP (Model Context Protocol) macOS Companion is an intelligent automation system that:

- Monitors screen content and file activities
- Stores memories with semantic search
- Orchestrates cross-service workflows
- Provides speech-to-text capabilities
- Offers contextual automation triggers

The backend is solid - now I need a polished native macOS interface that makes this powerful system accessible and user-friendly.

**Current priority: Start with SwiftUI menu bar app development.**

## üîß **PREFERENCES REMINDER**

For coding, I use:
- macOS 15 on M1 ARM iMac
- Always include full paths to apps/scripts
- Assume macOS environment for all CLI commands
- No comments in Bash commands (for easy copy-paste)

Let's build an amazing native macOS interface for this intelligent automation system!
